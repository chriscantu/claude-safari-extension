|------|------|--------|
| Tool registry (`registerTool` / dispatch) | [004](Specs/004-tool-registry.md) | ✅ |
| Tab group manager (`tabs_context_mcp`, `tabs_create_mcp`) | [013](Specs/013-tabs-manager.md) | ✅ |
| Background script event loop + polling | — | ✅ |
| Accessibility tree content script | — | ✅ |

---

## Phase 3 — Navigation ✅

URL navigation and browser history traversal.

## Milestone: First Build → `v0.1.0` 🔧

**Next up.** Fix critical bugs from [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md), compile, install, and verify end-to-end connectivity. Tagging `v0.1.0` is the first act that publishes an artifact — intentionally gated behind working end-to-end traffic so nothing is released in a broken state.

> **Versioning policy:** `0.x.x` throughout pre-release. The minor version bumps at each phase completion. `1.0.0` is reserved for when the extension is a genuine drop-in replacement for Claude in Chrome.

### Bug Fixes Required

| ID | Severity | File | Issue |
|----|----------|------|-------|
| C1 | 🔴 Critical | `AppDelegate.swift` | `toolRouter.setServer()` never called → all responses silently dropped |
| H1 | 🟠 High | `MCPSocketServer.swift` | Partial TCP writes silently discarded — needs retry loop |
| H2 | 🟠 High | `SafariWebExtensionHandler.swift` | Single-slot `UserDefaults` IPC drops concurrent requests |
| H3 | 🟠 High | `ToolRouter.swift` | `hybridTools` declared but never consulted (dead code) |
| H4 | ~~🟠 High~~ | `tool-registry.js` | ~~Core dispatch layer has zero tests~~ — ✅ fixed (tests added in Phase 4) |
| M1 | 🟡 Medium | `background.js`, `popup.js` | Bundle ID hardcoded in two files (DRY) |
| M2 | 🟡 Medium | `ToolModels.swift` | `NativeMessage` should be a Swift enum, not stringly-typed struct |
| M3 | 🟡 Medium | `manifest.json` | `persistent: false` + `setTimeout` polling fragile under suspension |
| M8 | 🟡 Medium | `tool-registry.js` | All results force-coerced to `text`; blocks image content type |

### Build & Install Checklist

- [ ] Fix C1, H1, H2, H3 (required for any traffic to flow end-to-end; H4 resolved)
- [ ] Fix M1, M2, M8 (required for Phase 4 tools to work correctly)
- [ ] `xcodebuild build -scheme ClaudeInSafari -destination "platform=macOS"`
- [ ] Run the app; verify MCP socket appears at expected path
- [ ] Enable extension in Safari → Settings → Extensions
- [ ] Send a `navigate` tool call from Claude Code CLI; verify response
- [ ] Tag `v0.1.0` → release workflow publishes unsigned `.app` archive to GitHub Releases
